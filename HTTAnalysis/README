# 2) Make the event weights tree. This TTree has lenght equal to sum of lenghts of
# input TTrees, so in particular order of tress in htt.ini is RELEVANT.
#To run this step one has to set
#
#
#processName = Weights
#

./test htt.ini #this creates TTree with PU weights


#  3) The main analysis. This step is expected to be run many times.
#  To run this step one has to set
#
#processName = Analysis
#

./test htt.ini      #this runs actual analysis and creates plots in fig_png and fig_C directories

#For the step 3) the processName can be any string except PU and Weights, which reserved for steps 1) and 2).
