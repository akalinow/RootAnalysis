### This file enables you to select which properties will be saved to TTree and for which particles (legs/jets)
### To select property write apropriate argument on the right of '=' sign, KEEP ONE BLANK SPACE!
### To select all legs write 'l'
### To select all jets write 'j'
### To select specific leg/jet write its number (from 1 up) e.g. 'j1' or 'l2'
### To deselect leave empty space on the right of the property name, e.g. 'charge =' or 'charge = '
